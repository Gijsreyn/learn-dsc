## Installing DSC for Windows using GitHub

To install DSC using GitHub, go through the following steps:

### Step 1 - Determine your OS architecture

There are multiple ways to determine the operating system (OS) architecture. The following three demonstrate using the command prompt PowerShell, or msinfo.

1. Open a command prompt and type `echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%`.
2. Open a PowerShell terminal session and type: `[System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation]::OSArchitecture`.
3. In your Quick Start menu, type in `msinfo32.exe` and locate the `System Type` property.

### Step 2 - Download the asset

After you've determined your OS architecture, it's time to download the release asset from GitHub.

1. Open the following [link](https://github.com/PowerShell/DSC/releases/) in your favorite browser.
2. Select the version you want to download and scroll-down.
3. Expand the "Assets" and press the asset relevant to your OS architecture.

    >}}

4. Save the file to your "Downloads" folder.

### Step 3 - Expand the archive and add to PATH

When the download is finished, you can expand the files to extract it towards your application data folder.

1. Right-click the file and select "Extract All..."
2. Extract the files to `C:\Users\<userProfile>\AppData\Local\dsc` by replacing the `<userProfile>` with your profile name
3. Open a command prompt and type `rundll32.exe sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables` to open the environment variables.
4. In your user variables, edit your `PATH` environment variable and include the path `C:\Users\<userProfile>\AppData\Local\dsc`.

### Step 4 - Verify the installation

1. Open a command prompt or PowerShell terminal session.
2. Type `dsc --version`

This should return the DSC version installed.

## Start as New Project

There are two main ways to add the Hextra theme to your Hugo project:

1. **Hugo Modules (Recommended)**: The simplest and recommended method. [Hugo modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) let you pull in the theme directly from its online source. Theme is downloaded automatically and managed by Hugo.

2. **Git Submodule**: Alternatively, add Hextra as a [Git Submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). The theme is downloaded by Git and stored in your project's `themes` folder.

### Setup Hextra as Hugo module

#### Prerequisites

Before starting, you need to have the following software installed:

- [Hugo (extended version)](https://gohugo.io/installation/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Go](https://go.dev/)

#### Steps

{{% steps %}}

### Initialize a new Hugo site

```shell
hugo new site my-site --format=yaml
```

### Configure Hextra theme via module

```shell
# initialize hugo module
cd my-site
hugo mod init github.com/username/my-site

# add Hextra theme
hugo mod get github.com/imfing/hextra
```

Configure `hugo.yaml` to use Hextra theme by adding the following:

```yaml
module:
  imports:
    - path: github.com/imfing/hextra
```

### Create your first content pages

Create new content page for the home page and the documentation page:

```shell
hugo new content/_index.md
hugo new content/docs/_index.md
```

### Preview the site locally

```shell
hugo server --buildDrafts --disableFastRender
```

Voila, your new site preview is available at `http://localhost:1313/`.

{{% details title="How to update theme?" %}}

To update all Hugo modules in your project to their latest versions, run the following command:

```shell
hugo mod get -u
```

To update Hextra to the [latest released version](https://github.com/imfing/hextra/releases), run the following command:

```shell
hugo mod get -u github.com/imfing/hextra
```

See [Hugo Modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/#update-all-modules) for more details.

When using [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) for Hugo website deployment, it's essential to ensure that the following command is executed before running the `hugo` command.

```shell
git submodule update --init
```

Failure to run this command results in the theme folder not being populated with Hextra theme files, leading to a build failure.


{{% details title="How to update theme?" %}}

To update all submodules in your repository to their latest commits, run the following command:

```shell
git submodule update --remote
```

To update Hextra to the latest commit, run the following command:

```shell
git submodule update --remote themes/hextra
```

See [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for more details.
