Welcome to the Learn DSC course!

## What is Learn DSC?

The Learn DSC website is designed to help both beginners and advanced users enhance their skills in Desired State Configuration (DSC) version 3. DSC has been completely rewritten in Rust, moving away from its original PowerShell foundation. For those familiar with earlier versions, understanding the evolution from PowerShell to Rust can make grasping the new concepts easier. If you are just starting out or already more experienced in DSC, this site provides resources to support your learning journey in the Jedi ranking order.

## Why should I use this site?

Having spend over two years after the initial release of DSC version 3 and releasing "[The DSC V3 Handbook](https://leanpub.com/thedscv3handbook)", it was time to put a huge amount of this knowledge for:
