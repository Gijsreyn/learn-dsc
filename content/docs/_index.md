Welcome to the Learn DSC documentation course!

## What is Learn DSC?

The Learn DSC website was created to help beginners and advanced folks to level up their skills in the new Desired State Configuration (DSC) version 3. DSC is totally rewritten in Rust, instead of using PowerShell. Folks coming from the early days recognize PowerShell as the primary driver of DSC. That's why relating earlier versions to each other, helps to grasp the concepts much quicker. This applies for both levels of where you are, wether you are just getting started, or already quite familiar in the field of DSC.

## Why should I use this site?

Having spend over two years after the initial release of DSC version 3 and releasing "[The DSC V3 Handbook](https://leanpub.com/thedscv3handbook)", it was time to put these learnings for:
