Learn DSC was created to provide a free and accessible learning platform for anyone that wants to learn about Microsoft Desired State Configuration (DSC). Recognized that many come from previous versions of PowerShell DSC and the open discussions that are ongoing, the need for a clear, structured resource to help many in different roles evolved.

## Why this site was created

While there is extensive content available through Microsoft Learn documentation, YouTube, and other platforms, having a structured learning path to systematically develop your skills from beginning to advanced levels is invaluable. The content here is open for community contributions and comes from experts in the field. I've been involved with DSC since its first alpha release and published "[The DSC V3 Handbook](https://leanpub.com/thedscv3handbook)", which complements the resources found on this site.

My passion for DSC has continued to grow, motivating me to create this site and become more involved in the DSC community. This community has existed for many years and has made significant contributions to the DSC landscape. Many find the transition between previous versions and DSC v3 challenging. I hope this content helps you easily integrate new concepts, even if you just getting started.
